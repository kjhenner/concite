Methods Ten patients with intestinal bleeding were first examined with double-balloon enteroscopy. If active bleeding considered as vascular malformation was observed, the patient underwent abdominal vascular-enhanced CT examination. If no active bleeding was observed with double-balloon enteroscopy, the patient also underwent abdominal vascular-enhanced CT examination. When intestinal vascular malformation bleeding was diagnosed with double-balloon enteroscopy and/or abdominal vascular-enhanced CT examination, the patient underwent surgical operation and vascular malformation was confirmed with pathologic diagnosis. Results In ten patients who underwent double-balloon enteroscopy examination, active intestinal bleeding was observed in seven patients and no active bleeding was observed in three patients. All ten patients underwent abdominal vascular-enhanced CT examination and vascular malformation was detected in all the patients with confirmation by pathologic diagnosis. Conclusion Double-balloon enteroscopy combined with abdominal vascular enhanced CT examination is a simple and effective method for the diagnosis of intestinal vascular malformation bleeding."}

Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of 77 patients who underwent both MR enteroclysis and VCE and compared the findings of these studies with the findings of enteroscopy, surgery, or with the results of clinical follow-up lasting ≥2 years. Results Findings included malignant neoplasms ( n  = 13), benign neoplasms ( n  = 10), refractory celiac disease ( n  = 4), Crohn’s disease ( n  = 2) and miscellaneous conditions ( n  = 10). Specificity of MR enteroclysis was higher than that of VCE (0.97 vs. 0.84,  P  = 0.047), whereas sensitivity was similar (0.79 vs. 0.74,  P  = 0.591). In 2/32 (6.3%) patients with both negative VCE and negative MR enteroclysis a positive diagnosis was established, compared to 5/11 (45.5%) patients in whom VCE was positive and MR enteroclysis was negative (likelihood ratio 8.1;  P  = 0.004), 9/11 (81.8%) patients in whom MR enteroclysis was positive and VCE was negative (likelihood ratio 23.5;  P  < 0.0001), and all 23 patients in whom both VCE and MR enteroclysis showed abnormalities (likelihood ratio 60.8;  P  < 0.0001). Conclusions VCE and MR enteroclysis are complementary modalities. In our study-population, MR enteroclysis was more specific than VCE, while both produced the same sensitivity."}

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic yield of magnetic resonance enteroclysis (MRE) and capsule endoscopy (CE) to balloon-assisted enteroscopy (BAE) in patients with suspected or established CD of the small bowel. Consecutive, consenting patients first underwent MRE followed by CE and BAE. Patients with high-grade stenosis at MRE did not undergo CE. Reference standard for small bowel CD activity was a combination of BAE and an expert panel consensus diagnosis. Analysis included 38 patients, 27 (71%) females, mean age 36 (20–74) years, with suspected ( n  = 20) or established ( n  = 18) small bowel CD: 16 (42%) were diagnosed with active CD, and 13 (34%) by MRE with suspected high-grade stenosis, who consequently did not undergo CE. The reference standard defined high-grade stenosis in 10 (26%) patients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value of MRE and CE for small bowel CD activity were 73 and 57%, 90 and 89%, 88 and 67%, and 78 and 84%, respectively. CE was complicated by capsule retention in one patient. MRE has a higher sensitivity and PPV than CE in small bowel CD. The use of CE is considerably limited by the high prevalence of stenotic lesions in these patients."}

However, the influence of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy on MRE features of CD severity remains unknown. The purpose of the study was to assess the short- and long-term changes in MRE features of CD activity in relation to CD clinical course in patients treated with anti-TNF antibodies. Methods  The influence on the most important parameters of CD activity seen in MRE was assessed retrospectively using a validated score. Patients were treated with anti-TNF agents and the clinical, laboratory, and MRE CD activity was estimated at baseline, after the induction therapy and after 1 year of treatment. Results 71 patients were enrolled in a study. The change in CD clinical activity correlated significantly with fluctuations in MRE activity score ( P  < 0.0001,  r  = 0.5 for induction;  P  = 0.004,  r  = 0.7 for maintenance anti-TNF therapy, respectively). Bowel wall thickening, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and fat wrapping with vascular proliferation were MRE parameters which changed significantly both after the induction and maintenance treatment in patients responding to the therapy. The change in MRE activity score was mostly pronounced during the first 3 months of treatment, when compared to the continuation of the therapy till week 52–54 (−6 points vs. −2 points, respectively;  P  = 0.0008). Conclusions  Transmural and extraintestinal healing seen in MRE correlates with changes in CD clinical activity during anti-TNF therapy, thus MRE seems to be a useful tool in monitoring the efficacy of biological agents."}

Methods Eighty-five patients with solid pancreatic lesions who underwent CE 3D US were retrospectively analyzed. Sixty-four patients had pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), 10 had mass-forming pancreatitis (MFP), and 11 had neuroendocrine tumor (NET). Two blinded readers evaluated the enhancement patterns using four features: vascularity in the arterial phase, vascularity in the venous phase, vessel location, and vessel form. Vascularity in both phases was classified as hypervascular, isovascular, or hypovascular. Vessel location was classified into peritumoral or intratumoral. Vessel form was classified into fine or irregular. Kappa values were used to assess inter-reader agreement. The institutional review board approved this study, and informed consent was obtained. Results Kappa values of the four features were 0.75, 0.72, 0.85, and 0.65, which were graded as good or excellent. The most typical combined enhancement pattern in PDAC was hypovascularity in both phases with peritumoral and irregular vessels; MFP was isovascular in both phases with intratumoral and fine vessels; and NETs were hypervascular in both phases with intratumoral and irregular vessels. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of the three patterns were 93.8% and 96.7% for the PDAC pattern, 80.0% and 100% for the MFP pattern, and 81.8%, and 69.2% for the NET pattern, respectively. The accuracy of these diagnostic criteria was 90.5%. Conclusion CE 3D US allows detailed visualization of the enhancement patterns of various pancreatic lesions and can be used for the differential diagnosis."}

Methods A retrospective chart review performed at a Canadian tertiary center specializing in the diagnosis and management of endometriosis. All cases with surgically confirmed endometriosis and an ETVUS completed at a single center were included for review and compared to routine TVUS performed for the same indication. Results Forty cases met the inclusion criteria. Mean patient age of the study population at first surgical diagnosis was 31.2 ± 6.9 years. Dysmenorrhea (76.9 %) and chronic pelvic pain (74.3 %) were the most common presenting symptoms. Sensitivity of routine TVUS was 25 % (10/40), compared to 78 % (31/40) with ETVUS, ( P  < 0.01). Comparisons were made based on site of disease. Routine TVUS and ETVUS detected bladder involvement in (0/40) vs. 5 % (2/40); ureter (0/40) vs. 7.5 % (3/40); ovary 25 % (10/40) vs. 72.5 % (29/40); retrocervical area (0/40) vs. 60 % (24/40), rectosigmoid 5 % (2/40) vs. 77.5 % (31/40), respectively. Specific endometriotic lesions recognized by TVUS versus ETVUS, were: ovarian endometriomas in 25 % (10/40) vs. 45 % (18/40), adhesions leading to abnormal anatomy in 2.5 % (1/40) vs. 77.5 % (31/40); endometriotic implants or plaques in 2.5 % (1/40) vs. 70 % (28/40); and endometriotic nodules in 2.5 % (1/40) vs. 35 % (14/40), respectively. Routine TVUS diagnosis relied on the presence or absence of endometrioma (10/10), whereas ETVUS showed additional sites of disease in 97 % (30/31) patients. Conclusions ETVUS is more sensitive than routine TVUS to diagnose endometriosis, identifying lesions other than endometrioma and is of assistance in surgical planning and patient counseling."}

In an 80-year-old woman, an approximately 8-mm papillary mass was incidentally detected at the downstream edge of a dilatated main pancreatic duct lumen on CT and MRI. Main pancreatic duct dilatation in the pancreatic body and tail and parenchymal atrophy were observed in the upstream of the mass. Histopathologically, the tumor protruded into the downstream edge of the dilatated main pancreatic duct lumen in the pancreatic body. The tumor cells had highly atypical nuclei and abundant polymorphic structures, and showed positive staining for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which led to the diagnosis of undifferentiated carcinoma. A total of 13 cases of undifferentiated carcinoma with intraductal tumor growth have been reported to date. The case report by Bergmann et al. has been the smallest in histopathological specimen, and the present case is the smallest in size detected by radiological images. Since early undifferentiated carcinoma of the pancreas can resemble those of main-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm in cross-sectional images, we have to consider undifferentiated carcinoma in the differential diagnosis of the solitary and papillary mass with low contrast enhancement in early phase in the main pancreatic duct."}

Materials and methods This single-center study was performed in a tertiary referral center for endometriosis. All patients ( n  = 28) who underwent segmental bowel resection (2004–2010) were retrospectively studied. MR images were analyzed by two experienced readers independently (number of lesions, location, size, signal intensity, and depth of bowel wall infiltration) and this was correlated with histopathology. Results The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy for diagnosis of endometriosis infiltrating the muscular layer of the bowel were 100%, 75%, 96%, 100%, and 96%, respectively. The inter-rater agreement was 0.84. “Fan shaped” configurations with hypointensity on T2- and T1-weighted imaging were characteristic for thickening of indigenous smooth muscle and smooth muscle hyperplasia at histopathology, as a consequence of infiltration by endometriosis. Thickening of the (sub)mucosa corresponded to edema with or without infiltration of endometriosis. Conclusion MR imaging at 1.5 Tesla is useful to predict muscular infiltration of the bowel in endometriosis, whereas it is of limited value in diagnosis of (sub)mucosal infiltration."}
