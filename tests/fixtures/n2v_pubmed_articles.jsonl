Purpose To investigate the effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) on Fas expression, apoptosis, and proliferation in serum-deprived rat disc cells. Overview of Literature Synthetic siRNA can trigger an RNA interference (RNAi) response in mammalian cells and precipitate the inhibition of specific gene expression. However, the potential utility of siRNA technology in downregulation of specific genes associated with disc cell apoptosis remains unclear. Methods Rat disc cells were isolated and cultured in the presence of either 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (normal control) or 0% FBS (serum deprivation to induce apoptosis) for 48 hours. Fas expression, apoptosis, and proliferation were determined. Additionally, siRNA oligonucleotides against Fas (Fas siRNA) were transfected into rat disc cells to suppress Fas expression. Changes in Fas expression were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and semiquantitatively analyzed using densitometry. The effect of Fas siRNA on apoptosis and proliferation of rat disc cells were also determined. Negative siRNA and transfection agent alone (Mock) were used as controls. Results Serum deprivation increased apoptosis by 40.3% ( p <0.001), decreased proliferation by 45.3% ( p <0.001), and upregulated Fas expression. Additionally, Fas siRNA suppressed Fas expression in serum-deprived cultures, with 68.5% reduction at the mRNA level compared to the control cultures ( p <0.001). Finally, Fas siRNA–mediated suppression of Fas expression significantly inhibited apoptosis by 9.3% and increased proliferation by 21% in serum-deprived cultures ( p <0.05 for both). Conclusions The observed dual positive effect of Fas siRNA might be a powerful therapeutic approach for disc degeneration by suppression of harmful gene expression."}

Purpose To evaluate the disability domains relevant to Indian patients with low backache and propose a modified disability questionnaire for such patients. Overview of Literature The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is a self-reported measurement tool that measures both pain and functional status and is used for evaluating disability caused by lower backache. Although ODI remains a good tool for disability assessment, from the Indian perspective questions related to weight lifting and sexual activity of ODI are questioned in some of the earlier studies. Activities of daily living in Indian patients vary substantially from those in other populations and include activities like bending forwards, sitting in floor and squatting which are not represented in the ODI. Methods In this prospective observational study, a seven-step approach was used for the development of a questionnaire. Thirty patients were interviewed to identify the most challenging issue they faced while performing their daily activities (by free listing) and understand how important the questionnaire items were in terms of the standard ODI. Thus, a comprehensive disability questionnaire comprising 14 questions was developed and administered to 88 patients. Both qualitative (interviews) and quantitative methods (to establish the validity, reliability, and correlation with the Visual Analog Scale [VAS] and Rolland Morris disability questionnaire) were used to identify the 10 questions that best addressed the disability domains relevant to Indian patients. Results According to free listing, four new questions pertaining to bending forward, sitting on the floor, walking on uneven surfaces, and work-related disabilities were included. In the second phase, wherein the questionnaire with 14 items was used, 56.8% patients did not answer the questions related to sexual activity, whereas 23.8% did not answer those related to walking on uneven surfaces. The modified questionnaire demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha=0.892) and correlation with the Rolland Morris questionnaire (Cronbach’s alpha=0.850,  p >0.05), as well as with the VAS score for disability (Cronbach’s alpha=0.712,  p >0.05) and pain (Cronbach’s alpha=0.625,  p >0.05). Conclusions A modified disability questionnaire that was designed by adding two questions related to bending forward and work status and removing questions related to sexual activity and weight lifting or traveling (depending on the occupation) can help evaluate disability caused by back pain in Indian population."}

Purpose We aimed to establish the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary workplace intervention on reduction of work-related low back pain (WRLBP), using ergonomic posture training coupled with an educational program based on social cognitive theory. Overview of Literature WRLBP is a major occupational problem among healthcare workers, who are often required to lift heavy loads. Patient handling is a particular requirement of nurse aides, and has been reported as the main cause of chronic WRLBP. Methods We included 125 nursing assistants from two hospitals affiliated to Qom University of Medical Sciences from May to December 2015. There was an intervention hospital with a number of 63 nursing assistants who received four multidisciplinary educational sessions for 2 hours each plus ergonomic posture training over two days and a control hospital with a number of 62 nursing assistants who didn't receive educational intervention about low back pain. The outcomes of interest were reductions in WRLBP intensity and disability from baseline to the follow up at 6 months, which were measured using a visual analog scale and the Quebec Disability Scale. Descriptive and analytical statistics were used to analyze the data. Results The comparison tests showed significant change from baseline in reduction of WRLBP intensity following the multidisciplinary program, with scores of 5.01±1.97 to 3.42±2.53 after 6 months on the visual analog scale in the intervention group ( p <0.001) and no significant change in control groups. There was no significant difference in the disability scores between the two groups ( p =0.07). Conclusions We showed that our multidisciplinary intervention could reduce the intensity of WRLBP among nurse aides, making them suitable for implementation in programs to improve WRLBP among nursing assistants working in hospitals."}

Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine whether discontinuing teriparatide treatment and replacing it with bisphosphonate treatment maintains the volume of the fusion mass after posterolateral fusion (PLF) in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Overview of Literature Clinical data support the efficacy of parathyroid hormone (PTH) for lumbar PLF. However, the use of PTH is limited to 2 years. Methods We treated 19 women diagnosed with osteoporosis and degenerative spondylolisthesis with teriparatide (20 µg daily subcutaneously). All patients underwent one-level instrumented PLF. Teriparatide was used during 2 months prior to surgery and more than 8 months after surgery. After discontinuing teriparatide treatment, all patients used bisphosphonate (17.5 mg risedronate weekly, oral administration). Area of the fusion mass across the transverse processes at one segment was determined on an anteroposterior radiograph at 1, 2, and 3 years after surgery. Results We followed 19 patients for 3 years. The average duration of teriparatide treatment was 11.5 months. The bone union rate was 95%. The average area of the bone fusion mass was not significantly different between the right and left sides at 1, 2, or 3 years after surgery ( p >0.05). Conclusions This study showed that replacing teriparatide treatment with bisphosphonate maintained the bone fusion mass volume after PLF in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis."}

Purpose To evaluate the reliability and validity of the adapted Korean version of the Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (ECOS-16). Overview of Literature The validity of the Korean version of ECOS-16 has not been completely demonstrated. Methods Translation/retranslation of the English version of ECOS-16, and full cross-cultural adaptation were performed. The Korean version of a visual analog scale measure of pain, and the Korean versions of ECOS-16 and of the previously validated short form-36 (SF-36) were mailed to 158 consecutive patients with osteoporosis. Factor analysis and reliability assessment using kappa statistics of agreement for each item, intraclass correlation coefficient, and Cronbach's α were done. Construct validity was evaluated by comparing responses to ECOS-16 with responses to SF-36 using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results Factor analysis extracted three factors. All items had a kappa statistics of agreement >0.6. The ECOS-16 showed good test/re-test reliability (0.8469) and internal consistency of Cronbach's α (0.897). The Korean version of ECOS-16 showed significant correlation with SF-36 total scores and with single SF-36 domains scores. Conclusions The adapted Korean version of the ECOS-16 was successfully translated and showed acceptable measurement properties. It is considered suitable for outcome assessments in Korean patients with osteoporosis."}

Magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass with a lipid component and calcifications inside within the right paravertebral musculature with a possible origin in the right C3 posterior root. A computed tomography scan and guided biopsy were performed, revealing hematic material and small bone spicules with no apparent neoplastic element. The tumor was totally removed, including the right C3 posterior branch, and was confirmed to be an osteolipoma on biopsy. The patient remains asymptomatic at 6-month follow-up.

Purpose To examine the effect of spino-pelvic sagittal parameters and back muscles on osteoporotic vertebral fracture. Overview of Literature Low bone mass is not the only important component of the risk on osteoporotic vertebral fracture; many other risk factors also contribute to skeletal fragility. Methods Seventy-two patients who had a lateral radiograph of the whole spine, magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine, and bone densitometry, were enrolled. The spino-pelvic sagittal parameters (pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt [PT], sacral slope, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis), age, lumbar bone mineral density, and amount of back muscle around the lumbar spine were analyzed. Results There was higher sagittal imbalance of the spine in the vertebral fracture group ( p =0.011). In spinopelvic parameters, the average of PT was 22.13° in vertebral fracture group and 13.70° in the non-fracture group ( p =0.002). The amount of lower back extensor muscle in the vertebral fracture group was 2,170 mm 2 , which was lower than the non-fracture group (3,040 mm 2 ,  p =0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis for the risk of osteoporotic vertebral fracture was significant in lumbar bone mineral density (odds ratio [OR], 0.313; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.139-0.706,  p =0.005) and the muscle ratio of extensor back muscle (OR, 0.902; 95% CI, 0.826-0.984;  p =0.020). Conclusions These results suggest that osteoporotic vertebral fracture could be developed easily by weakness of extensor back muscle in sagittal imbalance of the spine with high pelvic tilt."}

To validate translated version of the modified ODI in English version to Hindi. Overview of Literature Conflicting evidence in literature regarding the ability for existing ODI score to accurately measure the pain associated disability. Methods One hundred and three patients conservatively treated for low back pain were enrolled in the study. The Pearson correlation coefficient for VAS and ODI along with the Cronbach α and test-retest reliability for Hindi version using the intraclass correlation coefficient was recorded. The new proposed translated Hindi version of ODI was carried out with established guidelines. Results The mean age in English and Hindi version of ODI was 53.5 years and 58.5 years, respectively. The gender ration was 21:24 in the English version and 35:23 in the Hindi version. The mean follow-up in English and Hindi version of ODI was 3.4 months and 50.27 months, respectively. The Cronbach coefficient α=0.7541 for English ODI and 0.9913 for Hindi ODI was recorded for the both modified versions. Conclusions The new modified ODI is time saving and accurate, and it avoids the need to measure other scores and has stronger correlation with VAS score compared to the previous scores. We recommend this version for both English and Hindi speaking population as an assessment tool to measure the disability related to pain."}

Thus, the aim of this report is to present the surgical techniques and clinical results of 3 patients who were treated with this procedure. Three patients with tuberculous spondylitis at the thoracic spine were surgically treated with this procedure. All the patients presented with severe progressive back pain, kyphotic deformity and neurological deficit. The patients recovered uneventfully from surgery without further neurological deterioration. Their pain was improved and the patients remained free of pain during the follow-up period. In conclusion, posterior spinal shortening osteotomy is an alternative method for the management of tuberculous spondylitis."}

However, limited data are available regarding the impact of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency on scoliosis. Previous studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are prevalent in adolescents, including AIS patients. A series of studies conducted in Hong Kong have shown that as many as 30% of these patients have osteopenia. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 level has been found to positively correlate with bone mineral density (BMD) in healthy adolescents and negatively with Cobb angle in AIS patients; therefore, vitamin D deficiency is believed to play a role in AIS pathogenesis. This study attempts to review the relevant literature on AIS etiology to examine the association of vitamin D and various current theories. Our review suggested that vitamin D deficiency is associated with several current etiological theories of AIS. We postulate that vitamin D deficiency and/or insufficiency affects AIS development by its effect on the regulation of fibrosis, postural control, and BMD. Subclinical deficiency of vitamin K2, a fat-soluble vitamin, is also prevalent in adolescents; therefore, it is possible that the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is related to decreased fat intake. Further studies are required to elucidate the possible role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis and clinical management of AIS."}

Purpose To analyze different types of vertebral anomalies and the incidence of associated intraspinal anomalies in the Indian population. Overview of Literature This is the largest study of congenital scoliosis and associated intraspinal anomalies in Indian population. Incidence of intraspinal anomaly in this series is 47% which is higher than previous literature. Hemivertebra was the most common anomaly as seen in previous studies. Methods A total of 119 patients with congenital scoliosis who underwent surgery between December 2006 and December 2012 were studied. Data was reviewed with medical records, plain radiographs, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Results Thoracolumbar curve was most common, seen in 43.6% of patients. In addition to scoliotic deformity, kyphosis was seen in 26% of patients. Failure of formation, the most common vertebral anomaly, was seen in 51.2% of patients, failure of segmentation was seen in 19.3% of patients, and there were 29.4% patients having both formation and segmentation anomalies. Hemivertebra was the most common vertebral anomaly seen in 66.3% of patients and for whom 63.2% were in thoracic spine. Intraspinal anomalies were associated with 47% of patients with congenital scoliosis. Tethered cord was the most common intraspinal abnormality and was found in 48.2% patients with intraspinal anomalies. The patients with failure of segmentation and mixed deformities were found to have a significantly higher incidence of intraspinal anomalies (65% and 57%, respectively) than those with failure of formation (34%). Out of 31 patients with kyphotic deformity 29% had intraspinal anomalies, and amongst them tethered cord was the most common anomaly seen in 66% patients. Out of 12 patients with neurocutaneous markers, 83% patients had intraspinal anomaly. Conclusions Intraspinal anomalies were seen in 47% of patients with congenital scoliosis in the Indian population. Tethered cord was the most common intraspinal anomaly, seen in 48% cases of congenital scoliosis. Hemivertebra was seen in 66% cases and was the most common vertebral defect. Hence MRI imaging of whole spine should be done in all cases of congenital scoliosis before any surgical intervention. Special attention should be given to physical examination and visualization of any neurocutaneous markers, which are associated with a higher incidence of intraspinal anomalies; absence of a neurocutaneous marker, however, does not rule out intraspinal anomaly."}

Purpose To determine the safety and initial efficacy of intradiscal injection of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) releasate in patients with discogenic low back pain. Overview of Literature PRP, which is comprised of autologous growth factors and cytokines, has been widely used in the clinical setting for tissue regeneration and repair. PRP has been shown  in vitro  and  in vivo  to potentially stimulate intervertebral disc matrix metabolism. Methods Inclusion criteria for this study included chronic low back pain without leg pain for more than 3 months; one or more lumbar discs (L3/L4 to L5/S1) with evidence of degeneration, as indicated via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and at least one symptomatic disc, confirmed using standardized provocative discography. PRP releasate, isolated from clotted PRP, was injected into the center of the nucleus pulposus. Outcome measures included the use of a visual analog scale (VAS) and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ), as well as X-ray and MRI (T2-quantification). Results Data were analyzed from 14 patients (8 men and 6 women; mean age, 33.8 years). The average follow-up period was 10 months. Following treatment, no patient experienced adverse events or significant narrowing of disc height. The mean pain scores before treatment (VAS, 7.5±1.3; RDQ, 12.6±4.1) were significantly decreased at one month, and this was generally sustained throughout the observation period (6 months after treatment: VAS, 3.2±2.4, RDQ; 3.6±4.5 and 12 months: VAS, 2.9±2.8; RDQ, 2.8±3.9;  p <0.01, respectively). The mean T2 values did not significantly change after treatment. Conclusions We demonstrated that intradiscal injection of autologous PRP releasate in patients with low back pain was safe, with no adverse events observed during follow-up. Future randomized controlled clinical studies should be performed to systematically evaluate the effects of this therapy."}

Purpose To evaluate the advantages and effects of posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) using allograft and posterior instrumentation in the lumbar pyogenic discitis, which are resistant to antibiotics. Overview of Literature To present preliminary results of PLIF using a compressive bone graft with allograft and pedicle screw fixation in the lumbar pyogenic discitis. Methods Fifteen patients who had lumbar pyogenic discitis were treated by posterior approach from May 2004 to July 2008. The mean follow-up duration was 27.2 ± 18.68 months. The standing radiographs of the lumbar spine and clinical results were compared and analyzed in order to assess the bony union, the changes in the distance between the two vertebral bodies and the changes in the lordotic angle formed between the fused bodies immediately after surgery and at the final follow-up. Results Fifteen solid unions at an average of 15.2 ± 3.5 weeks after operation. The mean preoperative lordotic angle of the affected segments was 14.3 ± 15.1°, compared to 20.3 ± 12.3° after surgery and 19.8 ± 15.2° at last follow-up. For the functional result according to the Kirkaldy-Willis criteria, the outcome was excellent in 9, good in 5, fair in 1, and there were no poor cases. The average visual analogue scale score was decreased from 7.4 before surgery to 3.4 at 2 weeks postoperative. Conclusions The main advantage in the procedure of PLIF using compressive bone graft with allograft and post instrumentation is early ambulation. We believe that this is another good procedure for patients with poor general condition because a further autograft bone harvest is not required."}

Purpose To evaluate the incidence and risk factors of complications following posterior vertebral resection (PVR) for spinal deformity. Methods A review of 233 patients treated with PVR at one institution over a nine-year period (1997 to 2005) was performed. The average age was 33.5 years. Complications were assessed in terms of surgical techniques (posterior vertebral column resection [PVCR] and decancellation osteotomy) and etiologies of deformity. Results Local kyphosis was corrected from 51.4° to 2.7°, thoracic scoliosis 63.9° to 24.5° (62.6% correction), and thoracolumbar or lumbar scoliosis 50.1° to 17.1° (67.6%). The overall incidence of complications was 40.3%. There was no significant difference between PVCR and decancellation osteotomy in the incidence of complications. There were more complications in the older patients (>35 years) than the younger ( p  < 0.05). Hig her than 3,000 ml of blood loss and 200 minutes of operation time increased the incidence of complications, with significant difference ( p  < 0.05). More than 5 levels of fusion significantly increased the total number of complications and postoperative neurologic deficit ( p  < 0.05). Most of the postoperative paraplegia cases had preoperative neurologic deficit. Preoperative kyphosis, especially in tuberculous sequela, had hig her incidences of complications and postoperative neurologic deficit ( p  < 0.05). More than 40° of kyphosis correction had the tendency to increase complications and postoperative neurologic deficit without statistical significance ( p  > 0.05). There was 1 mortality case by heart failure. Revision surgery was performed in 15 patients for metal failure or progressing curve. Conclusions The overall incidence of complications of PVR was 40.3%. Older age, abundant blood loss, preoperative kyphosis, and long fusion were risk factors for complications."}

Purpose We intended to evaluate the efficacy of a 48 hour antibiotic microbial prophylaxis (AMP) protocol as compared with a 72 hour AMP protocol. Overview of Literature The current guideline for the prevention of surgical site infection (SSI) suggests the AMP should not exceed 24 hours after clean surgery like spinal surgery. But there exist some confusion in real clinical practice about the duration of postoperative antibiotic administration because the evidence of the guideline was not robust. Methods The subjects were 548 patients who underwent spinal surgery at our department from April 2007 to December 2008. The patients were classified into two groups according to the prophylaxis protocol: group A, for which AMP was employed for 72 hours postoperatively and group B, for which AMP was employed for 48 hours postoperatively. Five hundred two patients out of 548 patients were followed until 6 months postoperatively. The incidence of SSI in the two groups was analyzed. Results The overall infection rate was 0.8%. There was no significant difference in infection rate between the two groups. The overall infection rate for the patients who underwent instrumented fusion was 0.9%. There was no significant difference in the infection rate between the patients of the two groups who underwent instrumented fusion. Conclusions AMP for 48 hours is as efficient as AMP for 72 hours."}

Purpose We analyzed the clinical and radiological outcomes of minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody single level fusion. Overview of Literature Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion is effective surgical method for treating degenerative lumbar disease. Methods The study was conducted on 56 patients who were available for longer than 2 years (range, 24 to 45 months) follow-up after undergoing minimally invasive transforminal lumbar interbody single level fusion. Clinical evaluation was performed by the analysis of the visual analogue scale (VAS) score and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the Kirkaldy-Willis score. For the radiological evaluation, the disc space height, the segmental lumbar lordotic angle and the whole lumbar lordotic angle were analyzed. At the final follow-up after operation, the fusion rate was analyzed according to Bridwell's anterior fusion grade. Results For the evaluation of clinical outcomes, the VAS score was reduced from an average of 6.7 prior to surgery to an average of 1.8 at the final follow-up. The ODI was decreased from an average of 36.5 prior to surgery to an average of 12.8 at the final follow-up. In regard to the clinical outcomes evaluated by the Kirkaldy-Willis score, better than good results were obtained in 52 cases (92.9%). For the radiological evaluation, the disc space height ( p  = 0.002), and the whole lumbar lordotic angle ( p  = 0.001) were increased at the final follow-up. At the final follow-up, regarding the interbody fusion, radiological union was obtained in 54 cases (95.4%). Conclusions We think that if surgeons become familiar with the surgical techniques, this is a useful method for minimally invasive spinal surgery."}

Purpose The aim of the present study is to analyze the prevalence and distribution of cervical and thoracic compressive lesions of the spinal cord in lumbar degenerative disease, using whole-spine postmyelographic computed tomography. Overview of Literature Of the various complications resulting from spinal surgery, unexpected neurological deterioration is the most undesired. There are reports of missed compressive lesions of the spinal cord at the cervical or thoracic level in lumbar degenerative disease. Methods There were 145 consecutive patients with symptomatic lumbar degenerative disease evaluated. Before the lumbar surgery, image data were obtained. The following parameters at the cervical and thoracic levels were analyzed: compressive lesions from the anterior parts; compressive lesions from the anterior and posterior parts; ossification of the ligamentum flavum; ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament; and spinal cord tumor. Results Compressive lesions from the anterior parts were observed in 34 cases (23.4%). Compressive lesions from the anterior and posterior parts were observed in 34 cases (23.4%). Lesions of ossification of the ligamentum flavum were observed in 45 cases (31.0%). Lesions of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament were observed in 15 cases (10.3%). Spinal cord tumor was not observed. Conclusions A survey of compressive lesions at the cervical or thoracic level in lumbar degenerative disease is important in preventing unexpected neurological deterioration after the lumbar surgery."}
