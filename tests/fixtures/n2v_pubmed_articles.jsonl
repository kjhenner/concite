Purpose To investigate the effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) on Fas expression, apoptosis, and proliferation in serum-deprived rat disc cells. Overview of Literature Synthetic siRNA can trigger an RNA interference (RNAi) response in mammalian cells and precipitate the inhibition of specific gene expression. However, the potential utility of siRNA technology in downregulation of specific genes associated with disc cell apoptosis remains unclear. Methods Rat disc cells were isolated and cultured in the presence of either 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (normal control) or 0% FBS (serum deprivation to induce apoptosis) for 48 hours. Fas expression, apoptosis, and proliferation were determined. Additionally, siRNA oligonucleotides against Fas (Fas siRNA) were transfected into rat disc cells to suppress Fas expression. Changes in Fas expression were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and semiquantitatively analyzed using densitometry. The effect of Fas siRNA on apoptosis and proliferation of rat disc cells were also determined. Negative siRNA and transfection agent alone (Mock) were used as controls. Results Serum deprivation increased apoptosis by 40.3% ( p <0.001), decreased proliferation by 45.3% ( p <0.001), and upregulated Fas expression. Additionally, Fas siRNA suppressed Fas expression in serum-deprived cultures, with 68.5% reduction at the mRNA level compared to the control cultures ( p <0.001). Finally, Fas siRNA–mediated suppression of Fas expression significantly inhibited apoptosis by 9.3% and increased proliferation by 21% in serum-deprived cultures ( p <0.05 for both). Conclusions The observed dual positive effect of Fas siRNA might be a powerful therapeutic approach for disc degeneration by suppression of harmful gene expression."}

Purpose To evaluate the disability domains relevant to Indian patients with low backache and propose a modified disability questionnaire for such patients. Overview of Literature The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is a self-reported measurement tool that measures both pain and functional status and is used for evaluating disability caused by lower backache. Although ODI remains a good tool for disability assessment, from the Indian perspective questions related to weight lifting and sexual activity of ODI are questioned in some of the earlier studies. Activities of daily living in Indian patients vary substantially from those in other populations and include activities like bending forwards, sitting in floor and squatting which are not represented in the ODI. Methods In this prospective observational study, a seven-step approach was used for the development of a questionnaire. Thirty patients were interviewed to identify the most challenging issue they faced while performing their daily activities (by free listing) and understand how important the questionnaire items were in terms of the standard ODI. Thus, a comprehensive disability questionnaire comprising 14 questions was developed and administered to 88 patients. Both qualitative (interviews) and quantitative methods (to establish the validity, reliability, and correlation with the Visual Analog Scale [VAS] and Rolland Morris disability questionnaire) were used to identify the 10 questions that best addressed the disability domains relevant to Indian patients. Results According to free listing, four new questions pertaining to bending forward, sitting on the floor, walking on uneven surfaces, and work-related disabilities were included. In the second phase, wherein the questionnaire with 14 items was used, 56.8% patients did not answer the questions related to sexual activity, whereas 23.8% did not answer those related to walking on uneven surfaces. The modified questionnaire demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha=0.892) and correlation with the Rolland Morris questionnaire (Cronbach’s alpha=0.850,  p >0.05), as well as with the VAS score for disability (Cronbach’s alpha=0.712,  p >0.05) and pain (Cronbach’s alpha=0.625,  p >0.05). Conclusions A modified disability questionnaire that was designed by adding two questions related to bending forward and work status and removing questions related to sexual activity and weight lifting or traveling (depending on the occupation) can help evaluate disability caused by back pain in Indian population."}

Purpose We aimed to establish the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary workplace intervention on reduction of work-related low back pain (WRLBP), using ergonomic posture training coupled with an educational program based on social cognitive theory. Overview of Literature WRLBP is a major occupational problem among healthcare workers, who are often required to lift heavy loads. Patient handling is a particular requirement of nurse aides, and has been reported as the main cause of chronic WRLBP. Methods We included 125 nursing assistants from two hospitals affiliated to Qom University of Medical Sciences from May to December 2015. There was an intervention hospital with a number of 63 nursing assistants who received four multidisciplinary educational sessions for 2 hours each plus ergonomic posture training over two days and a control hospital with a number of 62 nursing assistants who didn't receive educational intervention about low back pain. The outcomes of interest were reductions in WRLBP intensity and disability from baseline to the follow up at 6 months, which were measured using a visual analog scale and the Quebec Disability Scale. Descriptive and analytical statistics were used to analyze the data. Results The comparison tests showed significant change from baseline in reduction of WRLBP intensity following the multidisciplinary program, with scores of 5.01±1.97 to 3.42±2.53 after 6 months on the visual analog scale in the intervention group ( p <0.001) and no significant change in control groups. There was no significant difference in the disability scores between the two groups ( p =0.07). Conclusions We showed that our multidisciplinary intervention could reduce the intensity of WRLBP among nurse aides, making them suitable for implementation in programs to improve WRLBP among nursing assistants working in hospitals."}

Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine whether discontinuing teriparatide treatment and replacing it with bisphosphonate treatment maintains the volume of the fusion mass after posterolateral fusion (PLF) in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Overview of Literature Clinical data support the efficacy of parathyroid hormone (PTH) for lumbar PLF. However, the use of PTH is limited to 2 years. Methods We treated 19 women diagnosed with osteoporosis and degenerative spondylolisthesis with teriparatide (20 µg daily subcutaneously). All patients underwent one-level instrumented PLF. Teriparatide was used during 2 months prior to surgery and more than 8 months after surgery. After discontinuing teriparatide treatment, all patients used bisphosphonate (17.5 mg risedronate weekly, oral administration). Area of the fusion mass across the transverse processes at one segment was determined on an anteroposterior radiograph at 1, 2, and 3 years after surgery. Results We followed 19 patients for 3 years. The average duration of teriparatide treatment was 11.5 months. The bone union rate was 95%. The average area of the bone fusion mass was not significantly different between the right and left sides at 1, 2, or 3 years after surgery ( p >0.05). Conclusions This study showed that replacing teriparatide treatment with bisphosphonate maintained the bone fusion mass volume after PLF in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis."}

Purpose To evaluate the reliability and validity of the adapted Korean version of the Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (ECOS-16). Overview of Literature The validity of the Korean version of ECOS-16 has not been completely demonstrated. Methods Translation/retranslation of the English version of ECOS-16, and full cross-cultural adaptation were performed. The Korean version of a visual analog scale measure of pain, and the Korean versions of ECOS-16 and of the previously validated short form-36 (SF-36) were mailed to 158 consecutive patients with osteoporosis. Factor analysis and reliability assessment using kappa statistics of agreement for each item, intraclass correlation coefficient, and Cronbach's α were done. Construct validity was evaluated by comparing responses to ECOS-16 with responses to SF-36 using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results Factor analysis extracted three factors. All items had a kappa statistics of agreement >0.6. The ECOS-16 showed good test/re-test reliability (0.8469) and internal consistency of Cronbach's α (0.897). The Korean version of ECOS-16 showed significant correlation with SF-36 total scores and with single SF-36 domains scores. Conclusions The adapted Korean version of the ECOS-16 was successfully translated and showed acceptable measurement properties. It is considered suitable for outcome assessments in Korean patients with osteoporosis."}

Magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass with a lipid component and calcifications inside within the right paravertebral musculature with a possible origin in the right C3 posterior root. A computed tomography scan and guided biopsy were performed, revealing hematic material and small bone spicules with no apparent neoplastic element. The tumor was totally removed, including the right C3 posterior branch, and was confirmed to be an osteolipoma on biopsy. The patient remains asymptomatic at 6-month follow-up.

Purpose To examine the effect of spino-pelvic sagittal parameters and back muscles on osteoporotic vertebral fracture. Overview of Literature Low bone mass is not the only important component of the risk on osteoporotic vertebral fracture; many other risk factors also contribute to skeletal fragility. Methods Seventy-two patients who had a lateral radiograph of the whole spine, magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine, and bone densitometry, were enrolled. The spino-pelvic sagittal parameters (pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt [PT], sacral slope, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis), age, lumbar bone mineral density, and amount of back muscle around the lumbar spine were analyzed. Results There was higher sagittal imbalance of the spine in the vertebral fracture group ( p =0.011). In spinopelvic parameters, the average of PT was 22.13° in vertebral fracture group and 13.70° in the non-fracture group ( p =0.002). The amount of lower back extensor muscle in the vertebral fracture group was 2,170 mm 2 , which was lower than the non-fracture group (3,040 mm 2 ,  p =0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis for the risk of osteoporotic vertebral fracture was significant in lumbar bone mineral density (odds ratio [OR], 0.313; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.139-0.706,  p =0.005) and the muscle ratio of extensor back muscle (OR, 0.902; 95% CI, 0.826-0.984;  p =0.020). Conclusions These results suggest that osteoporotic vertebral fracture could be developed easily by weakness of extensor back muscle in sagittal imbalance of the spine with high pelvic tilt."}

To validate translated version of the modified ODI in English version to Hindi. Overview of Literature Conflicting evidence in literature regarding the ability for existing ODI score to accurately measure the pain associated disability. Methods One hundred and three patients conservatively treated for low back pain were enrolled in the study. The Pearson correlation coefficient for VAS and ODI along with the Cronbach α and test-retest reliability for Hindi version using the intraclass correlation coefficient was recorded. The new proposed translated Hindi version of ODI was carried out with established guidelines. Results The mean age in English and Hindi version of ODI was 53.5 years and 58.5 years, respectively. The gender ration was 21:24 in the English version and 35:23 in the Hindi version. The mean follow-up in English and Hindi version of ODI was 3.4 months and 50.27 months, respectively. The Cronbach coefficient α=0.7541 for English ODI and 0.9913 for Hindi ODI was recorded for the both modified versions. Conclusions The new modified ODI is time saving and accurate, and it avoids the need to measure other scores and has stronger correlation with VAS score compared to the previous scores. We recommend this version for both English and Hindi speaking population as an assessment tool to measure the disability related to pain."}

A spinal shortening osteotomy procedure has previously been described for the correction of the sagittal balance in a late kyphotic deformity, but there have been no reports on this as a surgical treatment in the acute stage. Thus, the aim of this report is to present the surgical techniques and clinical results of 3 patients who were treated with this procedure. Three patients with tuberculous spondylitis at the thoracic spine were surgically treated with this procedure. All the patients presented with severe progressive back pain, kyphotic deformity and neurological deficit. The patients recovered uneventfully from surgery without further neurological deterioration. Their pain was improved and the patients remained free of pain during the follow-up period. In conclusion, posterior spinal shortening osteotomy is an alternative method for the management of tuberculous spondylitis."}

However, limited data are available regarding the impact of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency on scoliosis. Previous studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are prevalent in adolescents, including AIS patients. A series of studies conducted in Hong Kong have shown that as many as 30% of these patients have osteopenia. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 level has been found to positively correlate with bone mineral density (BMD) in healthy adolescents and negatively with Cobb angle in AIS patients; therefore, vitamin D deficiency is believed to play a role in AIS pathogenesis. This study attempts to review the relevant literature on AIS etiology to examine the association of vitamin D and various current theories. Our review suggested that vitamin D deficiency is associated with several current etiological theories of AIS. We postulate that vitamin D deficiency and/or insufficiency affects AIS development by its effect on the regulation of fibrosis, postural control, and BMD. Subclinical deficiency of vitamin K2, a fat-soluble vitamin, is also prevalent in adolescents; therefore, it is possible that the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is related to decreased fat intake. Further studies are required to elucidate the possible role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis and clinical management of AIS."}
