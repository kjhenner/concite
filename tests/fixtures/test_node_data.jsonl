This paper explains why it is important and why it is not a trivial problem, and proposes three models to handle spurious source words. Experiments show that any source word deletion model can improve a phrase-based system by at least 1.6 BLEU points and the most sophisticated model improves by nearly 2 BLEU points. This paper also explores the impact of training data size and training data domain/genre on source word deletion."}

This method makes it possible to do a quantitative comparison between the syntactic structures of each language, thereby providing a way of testing the Universal Grammar Hypothesis, the foundation of modern linguistic theories."}

We propose a method for analysing syntactic reordering in parallel corpora and apply it to understanding the differences in the performance of SMT systems. Results at recent large-scale evaluation campaigns show that synchronous grammar-based statistical machine translation models produce superior results for language pairs such as Chinese to English. However, for language pairs such as Arabic to English, phrasebased approaches continue to be competitive. Until now, our understanding of these results has been limited to differences in BLEU scores. Our analysis shows that current state-of-the-art systems fail to capture the majority of reorderings found in real data."}

The irregular characteristics of the real texts, especially without the strictly aligned paragraph boundaries, bring a challenge to alignment technology. The traditional alignment methods have some difficulties in competency for doing this. This paper describes a new method for aligning real bilingual texts using sentence pair location information. The model was motivated by the observation that the location of a sentence pair with certain length is distributed in the whole text similarly. It uses (1:1) sentence beads instead of high frequency words as the candidate anchors. The method was developed and evaluated through many different test data. The results show that it can achieve good aligned performance and be robust and language independent. It can resolve the alignment problem on real bilingual text."}

Analysis of addressing behavior in face to face meetings results in the identification of several addressing mechanisms. From these we extract several utterance features and features of non-verbal communicative behavior of a speaker, like gaze and gesturing, that are relevant for observers to identify the participants the speaker is talking to. A method for the automatic prediction of the addressee of speech acts is discussed."}

We present the first systematic analysis of several methods for assessing coherence under the framework of automated assessment (AA) of learner free-text responses. We examine the predictive power of different coherence models by measuring the effect on performance when combined with an AA system that achieves competitive results, but does not use discourse coherence features, which are also strong indicators of a learner’s level of attainment. Additionally, we identify new techniques that outperform previously developed ones and improve on the best published result for AA on a publically-available dataset of English learner free-text examination scripts."}

Several approaches have been proposed to define the probability of different paths through the lattice with external tools like word segmenters, or by applying indicator features. We introduce a novel lattice design, which explicitly distinguishes between different preprocessing alternatives for the source sentence. It allows us to make use of specific features for each preprocessing type and to lexicalize the choice of lattice path directly in the phrase translation model. We argue that forced alignment training can be used to learn lattice path and phrase translation model simultaneously. On the newscommentary portion of the German—*English WMT 2011 task we can show moderate improvements of up to 0.6% BLEU over a stateof-the-art baseline system."}

At the same time, the systems should be able to adapt to various situations and various users, so as to provide the most efficient and helpful mode of interaction. The aim of the Interact project is to explore natural human-computer interaction and to develop dialogue models which will allow users to interact with the computer in a natural and robust way. The paper describes the innovative goals of the project and presents ways that the Interact system supports adaptivity on different system design and interaction management levels."}

In this demonstration we present the integration of an engagement model in an existing dialog system based on interaction patterns. As a sample scenario, this enables the humanoid robot Nao to play a quiz game with multiple participants."}
